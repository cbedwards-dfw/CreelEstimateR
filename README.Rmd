# CreelEstimateR

The goal of CreelEstimateR is to ...

This package is an adaptation of...

## Dev notes:

- Will need to update documentation
- Many functions include `...` with no apparent use. I suspect these reflect additional
necessary arguments that have not been officially included in the function, like "params"?
- When using tidyverse tools in packages, `select`-type functions need to have all column 
names surrounded by quotes. `mutate`-type functions need to have `.data$` prepended to 
column names. I have attempted this, but may have mixed up some cases. Debugging may be necessary.

## Progress:

Some build cleanup will only be possible iteratively.

We should discuss which functions need to be exported. I haven't reached it yet, but there
may a single "control" function that is called, and which calls most/all the others?

### Converting:

- fetch_dwg
- fit_bss
- generate_analysis_lut
- get_bss_catch_daily
- get_bss_cpue_daily
- get_bss_effort_daily
- get_bss_overview
- map_data_grade
- plot_paired_census_index


### finalizing documentation:

## Installation

You can install the development version of CreelEstimateR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("cbedwards-dfw/CreelEstimateR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(CreelEstimateR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
