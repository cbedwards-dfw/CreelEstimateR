prep_inputs_bss,estimation,process-specific,"Translates the prepared tabular data into a list of the vector and matrix formats required by the stan model code and adds values for several priors; this function is iterated as a list of lists, with element of the outer list associated with each desired ""catch group"""

process_estimates_bss,post-processing,process-specific,"Wrangles BSS model output object (estimates_bss) into a standardized format at two scales. As estimates_bss is a ""list within a list"", each catch group has output objects within the larger list of estimates_bss. This function loops through each catch group and binds results into a single dataframe. The table is then pivoted to wrap estimate columns into ""estimate_type"" and ""estimate_value"" columns. Additional columns are added to retain project/fishery information and to match standardized table format. This process is does at the stratum scale and again at the total scale where the difference is which columns are selected during pivot_longer()"

At the ""stratum"" scale all of the data is retained at the original grouping levels and stratifications. At the ""total"" scale the model estimates are summarized by dropping the grouping variables section_num, period, day_type, and angler_final"
